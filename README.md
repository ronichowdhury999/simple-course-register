First I convert some fake data to json and put it in a file called.Fetch the data from data.json and put it in a hook called usestate. mage, a title, description, price, credits, and a select button. It was my intention that when I click on the select button another card will show the title of that card. Then I select the file in the parent file of the two files or the file which will get the data in both the files if I pass the data through perps. use onclick on the select button and pass the function to onclick and this function is an arrow function. Which is called HandleSelectButton.Then map this mutual array to another children file. which goes as an object and by destructuring this object I am able to display the title in the code
Pass some condition in handleSelectButton function to onclick used in that select button. The conditions are that if double is selected then it will show through alt message that 'this already selected' and credit value will not be more than 20. Put these values into two usestate hooks. Then I was able to complete the task using the interaction very easily.
